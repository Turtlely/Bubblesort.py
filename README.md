# Python Bubblesort
This is a generic bubblesort algorithm exercise, which includes timing code.

## USAGE
Replace the dataset I have in the program to whatever you want to sort.

This program contains code to time the sort, simply uncomment it to test out the time.

For reference, on my machine, it takes about 0.24ms (not updated)
